# CategoryWatchlist
This MediaWiki extension allows users to add/remove entire categories from their watchlist. Adding a category will actually just add all of the pages in that category, and likewise for removing it.

When a page is edited and it has a category added or removed, and that category is watched by a user, the page will be added or removed to/from the watchlist accordingly.
